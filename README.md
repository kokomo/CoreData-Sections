Core Data + Sections for iOS
=================

<img width=320 src="https://github.com/piotrdenis/CoreData-Sections/raw/master/img/sections.PNG"/>

Easy starting point for Core Data with automatic sections,
based on the day of entry.
Something like Facebook's timeline, something lots of people
keep asking about on Stack Overflow.

This is an extended version of Apple's Master-Detail Application
template with Core Data.

Just unzip and open the project template in XCode
and you are ready to go!
